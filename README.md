# Movie-TV-Discovery

A movie and TV show recommendation app using The Movie Database API

## About the Project

This idea originally came while browsing for something on the Letterboxd website. I thought to myself, "That seems generally easy," but I was wrong. Before starting this project, I didn't have any experience with GUI (Tkinter) or APIs. But through trial and error, I came up with this handy app that helps you discover movies and TV shows you'll love. It's powered by [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US).

## Features

* **Search for Movies**: Type in a movie name and get recommendations based on your search.  
* **Filter by Genre**: Choose your favorite genres, and let the app do the magic.  
* **Get Recommendations**: Discover movies and TV shows that are similar to the ones you already love.  
* **Beautiful Posters**: See fancy movie posters because, well, plain text is boring.  
* **Non-blocking UI**: The app doesn’t freeze while fetching data because who has time for that?

## Technologies Used

* **Python**   
* **Tkinter**   
* **Threading**   
* **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**   
* **PIL (Pillow)**

## What I Learned

* API integration and usage  
* GUI development with Tkinter  
* Working with images using the Pillow library  
* Handling data streams with BytesIO  
* Etc…


  

## Things I'm working on 

* **Code Refactoring**: Improve code organization and implement better separation of concerns.  
* **Error Handling**: Add robust error handling for API requests and user inputs.  
* **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts for personalized recommendations.  
* **Caching System**: Develop a more efficient caching system to reduce API calls.  
* **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the user interface design and overall user experience.  
* **Additional Features**: Add features like user ratings, reviews, and watchlists.  
* **Testing**: Implement unit tests and integration tests for better code reliability.  
* **Documentation**: Improve inline comments and create comprehensive documentation
